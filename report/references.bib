abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technologies has attracted considerable attention. However, little effort has been devoted toward investigating the large amount of trade data recorded in blockchains. This paper focuses on transaction data in Ethereum, which is a prominent public blockchain platform supporting not only secure cryptocurrency transfer but also various decentralized applications. By means of the framework of network science theory, we find that several transaction features, such as transaction volume, transaction relation, and component structure, exhibit a heavy-tailed property and can be approximated by the power law function. In particular, we find that the transaction relations follow a bow-tie structure with negative assortativity if they are regarded as a directed graph. The popular hubs tend to connect to a large number of common users. We believe that the aforementioned statistics can be ascribed to the vast diversity of transactions and the existence of a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to not only carry out a relatively comprehensive investigation of the transaction data recorded in Ethereum but also probe the statistical laws underlying the transaction relationships from the perspective of network science.}

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays,, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},
